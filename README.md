# NLP Languge Identifier
**The aim of this model is to identify the language used in the provided text snippet. This helps bridge communication gaps by allowing you to understand the content or translate it if needed.**

In this model we have used two methods:

1] Method 1: Using Python Module
- langdetect
- langid

2] Method 2: Using Machine Learning Algorithm (MultinomialNB)
- Import the libraries and dataset preprocessing
- Label Encoding and Text Preprocessing
- Train Test Splitting
- Model Training and Prediction
- Model Evaluation
- Making Predictions

**Thus, this model helps identify the language with the highest probability score as the most likely language of the text snippet.**
